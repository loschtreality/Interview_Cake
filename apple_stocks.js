// Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich. Maybe trading Apple stocks will.
// Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

// The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
// The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
// So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500;.

// Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

// For example:

// var stockPricesYesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

// getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday); returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
// No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).


const getMaxProfit = (stockPrices) => {
  let profit = stockPrices[1] - stockPrices[0]

  for (var i = 0; i < stockPrices.length - 1; i++) {
   profit = Math.max(profit, Math.max.apply(stockPrices.slice(i + 1), null) - stockPrices[i])
  }

  return profit
}


let stockPricesYesterday = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5]
console.log(getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday))
